# Image-classification

Image classification on the CIFAR100 dataset
This notebook compares the performance of multiple classifiers on the task of image classification with the CIFAR100 dataset. The classifiers used are SVM, KNN, Kmeans and CNN. KNN and Kmeans classifiers were built using numpy and imported from a custom file. SVM classifier is used from Scikit-learn and lastly the convolutional neural network model was built and trained using tensoflow.
